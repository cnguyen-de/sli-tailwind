<!--
A short introduction about myself.

My name is Chi, am currently a frontend engineer at DCP Connect.

As someone who likes to tackle on architectural and scaling topics within the frontend world, I like to play with ideas and implementing it  It's what makes the UI, sometimes it's hard to find a balance in separation of concerns between business logics and UI logics within the HTML templates.
